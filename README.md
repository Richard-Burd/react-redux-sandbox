## React-Redux Sandbox
Welcome to my React-Redux Sandbox, this is workspace that I use to tinker around with React (often paired with Redux) to get various features working properly before I use them in projects.&nbsp;  I'm currently using this repo to develop a series of cheat-sheets for React similar to [my other cheat sheets](https://richard-burd.github.io/portfolio/software#cheat-sheets-for-languages--frameworks).&nbsp;  So far I've got one going for the `useState` and `useEffect` React hooks:

If this Repo came up in a search and you're interested in pairing a Rails API back-end with a React front-end, you can go to my repo [here](https://github.com/Richard-Burd/react-redux-portfolio-project) and read this [here](https://richard-burd.github.io/react_setup_with_rails_api_server) but please don't clone this repo (like the last person) and then ask me for help getting it to work because this isn't an ideal solution as the repo actually contains several nested react applications within it, not just one.

## Instructions for Setting up Backend API for Final Portfolio Project

NOTE: This repo doesn't have a back-end Rails API; if you're looking for a repo with one of those then check out this one [here](https://github.com/Richard-Burd/react-redux-portfolio-project). and some notes on how to set one up [here](https://richard-burd.github.io/react_setup_with_rails_api_server). What follows are just some notes-to-self:

Instructions are here:
https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/

The repo this is based on is here:
https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails


The instructions start at the "Here we go" title

1.) ./portfolio-project (master) $ create-react-app client
      ...this will create a React app called "client"

2.) Create a backend Rails API app in the same directory:
    ./portfolio-project (master) $ rails new server --api
    ...this will create a Rails app called "server"

3.) Go into the backend Rails API app and add the following gem to the Gemfile:
    a.) gem 'foreman', '~> 0.82.0'
    ...then make sure to run bundle install

4.) inside (the main directory of ?) the backend Rails API create a folder called: Procfile

5.) Inside Procfile you need 2 lines of code that look like this:
    ```
    web: cd client && npm start
    api: bundle exec rails s -p 3001
    ```
6.) Inside the Rails app run this command:
    ./portfolio-project/server (master) $ foreman start -p 3000
    ...The client app will boot â€” we can see it running in our browser at
    localhost:3000. And our API server is up and listening at localhost:3001.
    Hitting CTRL+C kills both processes together, humanely.

7.) For our sanity, let's add a Rake task that executes this command for us.
    Create the file ```lib/tasks/start.rake:```
    ```
    task :start do
      exec 'foreman start -p 3000'
    end
    ```
    ...We can now boot the app with:
    ./portfolio-project/server (master) $ rake start
    NOTE: the file is here:
    https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails/blob/master/lib/tasks/start.rake

## Built Out A React Router:

completed this codealong until "30:00 / 33:09"
...the Fortnite API used in the codealong was down so I used a GOT API but it is
missing id's so it was unfinished.  The scaffolding is there and working though.

## Libraries Required for Final Project:
./portfolio-project (master) $ rails new back-end-api --api
./portfolio-project (master) $ npx create-react-app front-end
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install --save redux
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npx install redux react-redux
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install react-router-dom
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install --save redux-thunk
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install redux-logger ---- Vishwas method
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install axios redux-thunk ---- Vishwas method
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm i --save redux-logger ---- Some guy
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install --save redux-devtools-extension ----Vishwas method
NOTE: this last one is very important and makes the store a lot cleaner because you don't need this big
bag of verbage if you use it:
"window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__"

./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install fetch ?
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install node-fetch --save

trying to implement this here:
https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v8/module-17-redux/section-4-async-redux/redux-thunk

the code's problem could be anywhere between these files:

react-redux-demo/src/components/Astronauts.js
react-redux-demo/src/redux/astronauts/actions/fetchAstronauts.js
react-redux-demo/src/redux/astronauts/reducers/astronautsReducer.js
